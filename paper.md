## Supplementary Movies

[SM1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kYQ08wkxQSVNKPTcDjExMeWcO-_lcIr/view?usp=drive_link): Movie of the aversive airpuff sequence, termed ``attack'' event, delivered by the airpuff module. Green timer in background to illustrate event duration.\
[SM2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CFKGqN_E3kLcLlZ1kaWFpweNhRsrIOGm/view?usp=drive_link): Movie of FMM13 fleeing from the robot following an prey enters arena'' experiment event is triggered and the robot begins autonomous motion. Cyan dot indicates the mouse's location.\
[SM3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hTnazNUwTexS4V1q34gw31Hbr2WWD43k/view?usp=drive_link): Movie of FMM16 during pilot study where mice first interacted with a pursuing robot with airpuff disabled for two sessions. This movie shows the mouse's first experimental session with the puff enabled.\
[SM4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HNPp-ZUfcWcXzqO9hbwgw8Wbi8MzIKxi/view?usp=drive_link): Movie of MMM16 during pilot study with airpuff disabled.\
[SM5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I4GmLt-zJu317692L_qIAbHeZkEBi_te/view?usp=drive_link): Movie showing an example of a stereotypical trajectory without the robot (T phase) and in the presence (first clip) and absence of obstacles
(second clip).  
[SM6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITuEYMaQK5Dx2QBWYJRPyuGJCTomNtZU/view?usp=drive_link): Movie showing an example trajectory with the robot (R phase) in the presence and absence of obstacles. First clip: Movie of FMM10 during its seventh day of the R phase. The mouseâ€™s first line of sight with the robot occurs at frame 590. Second clip: Movie of trial in the open field arena with the robot (R phase). The robot shown is not the robot used during the BotEvade task, it is an earlier iteration
of the robot.  
[SM7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g2lOW1llN4LFSv82--t0fAXqmXnw7gru/view?usp=drive_link): Movie of FMM9 during its first experiment session after the robot was removed (PR phase).        
[SM8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2H_GFfH4ybiEwsobWq-ZyZ6sgH7nODA/view?usp=drive_link):  Hand-selected bait example.   
[SM9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wp97JFy9y6iO8BQkyy7jMH0DEnqbzOoQ/view?usp=drive_link): Hand-selected peek example.   
[SM10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kSjvDAjUnCyzDQue56vo5ga-isZFuUMm/view?usp=drive_link): To determine the effect on the mouse of suddenly changing the robot's behavior, this is a movie of a trial where the robot was turned off in the middle. In this trial, the mouse engages an extended sequence of peeks and reroutes as it surveys the now stationary robot.
