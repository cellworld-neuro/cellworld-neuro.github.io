## Supplementary Movies

[SM1](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wH3VsdWOeWc_PXIToa9uanlwF_mSJ81q): Movie of the aversive airpuff sequence, termed ``attack'' event, delivered by the airpuff module. Green timer in background to illustrate event duration.\
[SM2](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1pMLhaBUBCCgpP3fxhqoOymh2Okf2BOyR): Movie of FMM13 fleeing from the robot following an prey enters arena'' experiment event is triggered and the robot begins autonomous motion. Cyan dot indicates the mouse's location.\
[SM3](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YlUPlhfVbiJ_joUgb7jCGGT-35t5DlWd): Movie of FMM16 during pilot study where mice first interacted with a pursuing robot with airpuff disabled for two sessions. This movie shows the mouse's first experimental session with the puff enabled.\
[SM4](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vA8moctDiIVPVZlnUgdR9-u4QtcgmXqG): Movie of MMM17 during pilot study with airpuff disabled.\
[SM5](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JJlFmGVMN97xw_w0a87Er2vfxcbc9KMV): Movie showing the shortest path traversed by a mouse\
[SM6](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1we5Un72uG5LVmv89HUbQ7e-_4RGBiQd7): Movie showing an example of a longer path traversed by a mouse \
[SM7](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1beqUk0srYul24GL4T_-r3c-ChWxKIwXF): Movie showing an example of a stereotypical trajectory \
[SM8](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/123eDgZaAbt0gY9o46qgfL19JQXDN8E7E): Example trial in an open field arena with no robot (T phase).\
[SM9](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19_1da6jGl01E09VX4QpjNGpf0_Rb0rdy): Example trial in an open field arena with no robot (T phase).\
[SM10](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zlhnVnm4CDqQC0zkgmqlO20fuy26ALTE): Movie of FMM10 during its first day of the R phase. During this phase routes became more variable. Shown is a longer observed path.\
[SM11](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zlhnVnm4CDqQC0zkgmqlO20fuy26ALTE): Movie of FMM10 during its seventh day of the R phase. The mouse's first line of sight with the robot occurs at frame 590.\
[SM12](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12t4lRwMQPau_KHeDOvpF1YCxWX00uTtZ): Movie of trial in the open field arena with the robot (R phase). The robot shown is not the robot used during the BotEvade task, it is an earlier iteration of the robot.\
[SM13](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19g3LbPuU8vOAXxF2HX2ZEql4tZQkevDe): Movie of FMM9 during its first experiment session after the robot was removed (PR phase).\
[SM14](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/146Msjds134yZNo1J0-NzFX05HJ8u-lHV): Movie of FMM10 during the R phase. In the trial the mouse has no line of sight with the robot.\
[SM15-SM24](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zg8D8DgwM5rZ7P7uSJYOL0JmvQmUrR2N): Hand-selected bait examles.\
[SM25](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EtGqj_ehLoJPu-_GlxpgesdleWX6Azsg): Movie showing an example baiting sequence.\
(1, frames 1--329) the mouse comes to a point where it is seen by the robot.\
(2, frames 330--462) The mouse then retreats,\
(3, frames 463--801) provoking the robot to pursue.\
(4â€“-5, frames 802--1006) This retreat-pursue cycle repeats until\
(6, frames 1007--1190) the robot is close to the start gate, allowing the mouse to outmaneuver the robot.\
[SM26-SM40](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1E14kDXxN7EU2mBPErM2pGoyYl0deI5zX): Hand-selected peek examples.\
[SM41](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1O285nNpevaEXUKaPw6Jg7GdOMaOPt_h6): Movie showing an example peeking event.\
(1, frames 1--525) the mouse makes initial contact with the robot, retreats and then\
(2, frames 526-579) peeks before\
(3, frames 580-576) rerouting and escaping the robot.\
[SM42](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vpGnVcMYe1uUDI8d0F2KznocJCjVok0b):  To determine the effect on the mouse of suddenly changing the robot's behavior, this is a movie of a trial where the robot was turned off in the middle. In this trial, the mouse engages an extended sequence of peeks and reroutes as it surveys the now stationary robot.\
[SM43](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19Tm9krqzklYqZW64LPpMA-JQknrlbcBX): Movie of a trial with an earlier iteration of the robot that is not equipped with the air puff module. In this movie the robot is not autonomous---it's controlled by a user with a joystick. The user inputs maneuvers like rapid spinning in attempt to elicit a fear response in the mice.\
[SM44](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oU356wvj2YcEEi4_0yp5Cvdv34g_Jco3): Movie of a trial with the airpuff disabled. Here the mouse climbed onto and stayed on the moving robot.
